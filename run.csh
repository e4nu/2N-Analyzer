# run.csh
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Main entry script for the 2N-Analyzer workflow.
# This script performs three possible operations in sequence:
#   1) Update the repository (git pull and cleanup)
#   2) Configure and build the C++ analysis code with CMake
#   3) Run the analysis executable (TwoNAnalyzerReco)
#
# The behavior can be controlled with command-line flags:
#   --git-pull <true|false>   enable or disable repository update
#   --build    <true|false>   enable or disable CMake configure/build
#   --run      <true|false>   enable or disable running the executable
#
# Any other arguments are forwarded directly to the C++ executable.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Usage:
#   ./run.csh
#     Pulls latest changes, configures/builds, then runs TwoNAnalyzerReco.
#
#   ./run.csh --git-pull false
#     Skips git pull, but still builds and runs.
#
#   ./run.csh --build false
#     Skips configure/build, but still runs the existing executable.
#
#   ./run.csh --run false
#     Pulls and builds, but does not run the executable.
#
#   ./run.csh --git-pull false --build false --run true --sample-chain config/samples/RecoSampleChain_Data.yaml
#     Uses existing build and forwards the remaining arguments to TwoNAnalyzerReco.
#
# Typical SSH workflow:
#   ssh <user>@<host>
#   cd /path/to/2N-Analyzer-e4nu
#   ./run.csh
#
# SSH-friendly helper:
# 1) Optionally update local repo
# 2) Optionally configure + build with CMake
# 3) Optionally run the reco executable

# Determine how this script was invoked.
# If the script is executed normally (./run.csh), $0 contains the script path.
# If the script is sourced (source run.csh), $0 may contain the shell name
# (for example "tcsh" or "-tcsh").  We detect this and treat the current
# working directory as the script directory in that case.
# 
# Resolve script directory and switch to it so all relative paths work.
# When sourced (`source run.csh`), $0 may be the shell name or shell path
# (for example "-tcsh" or "/bin/tcsh"), so we fall back to current working
# directory in those cases.
